# Elm Truffle Box

This box helps you get started building dApps with Truffle and Elm, using the [Elm Ethereum](https://github.com/cmditch/elm-ethereum) library.

To build your Elm app, edit the code in `src/`, then run `elm-make src/Main.elm --ouput build/elm.js`.

To test your app, you can use `http-server` (`npm install -g http-server`) to serve the it: `http-server build`.

The Elm boilerplate in this repository is modified from the examples by cmditch in the Elm Ethereum repository.
